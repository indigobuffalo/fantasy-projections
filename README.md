# fantasy-projections

Scripts for comparing and averaging fantasy rankings.

## Converting between Numbers and Excel

Microsoft Excel requires a paid subscription to save files.  To get around this, open in Numbers, make your edits, then export back to Excel.

Note: Don't include summary page when exporting to Excel.

## Specifying Players to Search

See the lists under input/player_rgxs.py.
- QUICK_COMPARE: will be used if it's non-empty. Use it when you want to quickly compare a couple players, empty it otherwise.
- [KKUPFL|PA]_PLAYERS: self-explanatory
